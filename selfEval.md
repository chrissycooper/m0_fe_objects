# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
commas vs semicolons! I kept putting semicolons where there should be a comma. I think this is because of english grammar training. I notice when I am writing code, I will think ahead and forget steps, and then have to go back and add my variable name or a bunch of commas. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going fairly well. It's been a while since I've been in a classroom setting, so it's been a good refresher for me to what will work for me. I'm noticing it helps me more not to take too many notes during lectures, because I can get behind when I try to write down what you were saying and I can't listen quite as well when I'm writing. So I've been taking some screenshots, and trying to write in commentary more than content. 


- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try to solve the problem if I can on my own, even if it's part way I like to see what works if anything, and then I'm trying to refer to the turing guides first before googling. Sometimes when I get a weird error I don't understand I'll try to give that a google. 
I think this is a skill that also translates well from working as an artist and learning new mediums. The view I've had with that is to explore the medium, and see what it can do, and how it changes my idea and thinking from concept to action.
